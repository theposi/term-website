([[;#64ED6C;]*]) Jmmm it seems you're a bit gossipy huh?, well now that you wanna stalk me I'll let you know more about me ‚Äæ\\['-']/‚Äæ

My name is [[;#64ED6C;]Cristian Zapata], I am a 25 years old [[;#64ED6C;]Graphic Designer, Software developer, and content creator] on the journey
to become [[;#64ED6C;]SysAdmin] and [[;#64ED6C;]DevOps Engineer].

A few years ago I discovered my passion for tech and arts, and seeking to merge these passions, I started learning front-end development
on my own, and during my Graphic Design degree I worked as a front-end developer in an e-commerce company called [[!;;;;https://rocketfy.com/]Rocketfy] for thousands
Latin American sellers where I learned a lot and I realized tech is mooooore big than I thought.

Now I'm studying software development in 42 Madrid where I've had the opportunity to dive into Linux systems, programming in C,
shell scripting, and discovering a new love there. Apart from that I work on some projects as my configs for Linux with my dotfiles,
my personal neovim and window manager configurations, and also blog all those interesting things I'm learning in this path trying to
share my knowledge, experience, and maybe helping someone all this can be helpful.

Out of the screen my [[;#FF4747;]hobbies] are:
    [[;#FF4747;]@] Hiking, climbing and calisthenics 
    [[;#FF4747;]@] The sculpturing
    [[;#FF4747;]@] Made some custom keyboards
    [[;#FF4747;]@] The art and photography ([[!;;;;https://www.instagram.com/zac_359/]here] my art Instagram)

Please feel free to get in touch with me to discuss any cool opportunities or ideas. My contact details can be found by typing '[[;#64ED6C;]socials]',
and if you would like to check out my CV just type '[[;#64ED6C;]cv]'.
